# CSCI215_Lab_06
Styling and validating a form

This will be a two-part lab. Part 1 will consist of creating a form in HTML and style in CSS. This will emphasize skill that were learned in CSCI-115 but will also improve on design elements that are crucial in Website Programming. Part 2 will incorporate the JavaScript language to be used for form validation.

## Part 1
Perform the steps in **Tutorial: Styling a Form**. These steps can be found in the PDF directory.

## Part 2
Write JavaScript that will check the user's name to ensure that it only contains valid letters for a name. This should be contained in it's own function called checkName(name)
